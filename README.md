# Distrust: Trust No One

Distrust is a chat server and client where the server does as little of the work as possible. By moving the encryption and decryption to the client the users of the application can be sure the server cannot read the exchanged messages.


Furthermore Distrust will empower users to explore the basics of cryprography and even allow for users to generate their own cryprographic keys!

# Nerd Stuff

Distrust is a full stack javascript application; Node.js with Express on the backend and Svelte on the front end. Distrust will be available in as an easily deployable docker container once I get around to working on it.
